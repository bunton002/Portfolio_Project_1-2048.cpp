# Portfolio_Project_1-2048.cpp
Antons project of learning C++.

This is a simple project I made in order to learn the very basics of C++.
I didn't use classes, and I kept it to be as basic as possible, while still doing everything it should. It's also completely commented.

Don't really know what else to write here, considering it truly is very basic even though it took me a few weeks to truly be ok with this.

Things I could do better next time; 
1. Use a class.
2. Create an ingame message telling "You won!" instead of booting you out and outing it to the console that "You won!"
3. Many different tricks could probably be used to optimize the code further, though it is unneeded right now for a game as simple as 2048.
